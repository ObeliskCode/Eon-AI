# Noel's Game of Life
I am interested in creating another version of conway's game of life in order to examine a theoretical framework I created. 
## The Huilon Theory
A Huilon is a theoretical framework for an idea of a particle beneath Planck's Constant.
A Huilon is both vacuumous and spacious.
### hypothesis
A quark would then be made of Huilons and forces to move quarks could be researched.
Huilons exist in I space or Imaginary Space. 
Huilons are a Imaginary Topological space. 
the set I of imaginary numbers is the basis of negative space.
## Huilon Axioms
1. Ad Infinitum a huilon never changes shape
2. A huilon can change shape Ad Infinitum
3. Two consequent huilons are the same huilon (one topological space)
4. Consequence is a paradox itself, every combination of huilons both exist and don't exist
5. adding huilons evolves the huilon
6. subtracting huilons devolves the huilon
## The Huilon Game of Life
a Huilon will be a shape in IR3 or Imaginary Real 3D Space.
the operation that combines Huilons will be the XOR function on area.
AI will then be trained to trade Huilons with each other to maximize area.
## Leading Theory
Point Theory

1. There is no physical distance between any two points
2. distance is a measure of consequence between two points

I previously surmised many things in quantum theory many of which are well known literature now.
I once thought a plate falling perfectly to create a dribbling effect was the true nature of quantum entanglement motion.
Literature now says that everything vibrates together to support quantum tunneling and literal action at a distance. 
literal action at a distance is forces at a distance but quantum tunneling is matter moving no distance apparently!

At the same time I surmised another structure. A sequence of infinitely unique characters.
How can a character never be repeated in a sequence.
I call this an informal number because it breaks many conventions of math.

I came up with conjector theory after this discover.
Planar computations are done with informal numbers.
An informal number is organized such as a vector. 
Two 1-dim informal numbers operated together requires a single infinity.
An informal matrix is the k>=2 k-dimensional version of an informal number.
Calculations done requiring k-dimensional informal numbers requires inf^k to compute.
inf is not a number it is a constant. inf^0 = inf, inf^1 = inf, inf^k = inf.
There is no infinity that is not an infinity.
conjector theory says that because of hard limits on physical computational requirements that there exists a critical conjector functions which lowers a k-dimensional informal number to a 1-dim space. The universe itself is represented by a single informal number.

Huilon theory is the final conclusion I've made to try to encapsulate literal action at a distance.
This is a force that stems from the idea that consequence between a thing and anything else could be a force which may just be god's handiwork.

## Noel's Theory

This theory means inanimate force at a distance is possible through god.

I claim to have disproven Geodell's incompleteness by proving P=NP through the completion of Zermelo-fermet Set Theory.

I have devised rules for what i am calling the reductive proof method (derivative superset math) and the enductive proof method.
 
An Informal Number is a Complex Number with a restricted i component (to R/Q).
