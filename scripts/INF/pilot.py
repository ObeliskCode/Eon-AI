## tensorflow objective:

## the first principle of this AI is the stack & recursion

## so imagine black-jack or 21 then imagine that the whole
## number provided is when you're number goes bust based
## on it's maximum either leading to and ilc or an ilc

## that means that the model has to have an input
## shape of 1 and output shape of 1 recursively.

## the point of this is that the model will
## be made in two points as an empty tuple
## by default and an only a single addition
## to the tuple and it's target black-jack number

## so the model needs to be geared to be able
## to train with mutable variables of size n and a number then
## output to a single number

## I need to retool this pilot.py to make this possible
## how do I train an AI which has a mutable input size
## to begin with? [TODO]

## the black-jack prediction model should be a model
## which feeds into another prediction machine
## the problem is that it should be a purely statistical
## machine which means MSE should be perfect
## for a hyper-parameter tuning machine
## which will grade the machine for potential
## loss at every point, card game AI.
