## Reinforcement Learning for ILC AI

## 5 features

## 1. the target number
## 2. amount of guesses already made
## 3. current maximum (total)
## 4. incomplete/complete
## 5. amount of missing numbers in set

## Output is then the next guess in the ILC

## So an ILC is built one addition at a time
## as the learning enviroment or (game)
## that the reinforcement learning will try
## to complete optimally

## a simple test could be a simple NN designed
## around 5 input neurons to 1 output neuron
