## Informal Number Group

+>x = {+/- x, +/- (x-1), +/- (x+1), 0}

+>x + +>y = {all numbers in both +>x added together} = N

2. the set N can return either 5,7,...,19,21,...,31,33 numbers

3. there are 15 different cardinalities for the set of adding two informal numbers
   together

## Informal Number Basics

x uses only whole numbers 0,1,2,...,n to inf when, +>x is an informal number

+> x is equal to {-x-1,-x,-x+1,0,x-1,x,x+1}

+> x + >y = {all num in +>x added together with all num in +>y}

a set only contains unique numbers!

+> x + >y = {[{all num in +>x}] + [{all num in +>y}]}

commutativity of addition means add from left to right and right to left above.

## Informal Analysis

does H(M) + H(N) = H(M+N)

does the decomposition of integers addition relate to,
O(1) integer addition with O(1) matrix addition

1. H(+>1 + +>2) + H(+>1 + +>2) = H(2+>1 + 2+>2)
2. H(+>1 + +>2) = 5
3. H(2+>1 + 2+>2) = 10
4. H(+>1 + +>2) + H(+>1 + +>2) = 5 + 5 = 10

result: 
iff H(+>x + +>x) != NIL then, 
H(+>x + +>x) = (x+1) + (x+1), since
+>x + +>y = +>y + +>x

so,
H(+>10 + +>15 + +>8) = 36
but,
H(+>10 + +>15) = NIL

so for every whole number x 
there is a finite amount of "special" ways
to add up to the whole number x

my theory is that this is how to "quantify" addition

any whole number integer is re presentable by a finite amount of arrays of informal numbers which allows
for matrix addition to represent integer addition, every time a register adds up amounts of +>(x) in 64 bits
it allows for a computation of H(f(x)) to calculate an infinite number with decentralized computation that 
means a decentralized computation could add up an indefinite number

3SAT methodology:

so, +- 1 = 1 or -1 to be exact,
then +- 1 or 0 = +> 0
then, +> 0 + +> 0 = +> 1
and, +> 1 = -2 or -1 or 0 or 1 or 2
then, +>1 = +- 1 or +- 2 or 0
why is (+- 1 or 0) + (+-1 or 0) possibly
a function reducible to 3SAT?

so, (+- 1 or 0) + (+-1 or 0)
then, (+- 1 or 0) and (+-1 or 0)

so,
+>10 + +>15 + +>8 = 
(+-9 or +-10 or +-11 or 0) and
(+-14 or +-15 or +-16 or 0) and
(+-7 or +-8 or +-9 or 0)

there is an equation for satisfiability here!

so a chain of numbers with and operations
could lead to a reduction trivially

so, is (10 and 15 and 8) a special list?
the answer is yes or no.
computational hardness proof required.

let's say we reimagine inf number so that

"""
def infn_set_pow2(x):
    return set([-x-2,-x - 1, -x, -x + 1,-x+2, 0, x-2,x - 1, x, x + 1,x+2])
"""

then we have 'infn_set_pow2(0)' = 2
so then that means since we know,
H(10 and 15 and 8) is 36
then
let H^2 be the 3SAT halting machine for 'infn_set_pow2'
H^2(10 and 15 and 8) is 39?
but we know that iff H(f(x)) is valid,
then H^2(f(x)) is valid 

H^inf(+>x + +>y) = (x+1) + (y+1) + 2(inf)
then, H^C(+>x + +>y) = (x+1) + (y+1) + 2(C)

Corollary:
H^inf(+>x + +>y) = (x+1) + (y+1) + 2(inf)
then, H^C(+>x + +>y) = (x+1) + (y+1) + 2(C)

if H^inf(+>x + ...) then (x0+1) + ... + n(inf)
then it is possible that then we have,

for ex (x0+1) + ... = 12
then,
12 + n(inf) = 6*2 + n(inf)
so is it possible that we can enemurate amount of factors
for 12 this way some how then ?

Informal Abstract Algebra:

the informal number set is not equivalent to the integers.

if we imagine group relations then we have a function for
generating subsets of the entire set denoted <a> to be 
a generated set where a is an element of X (informal numbers).

Calculate: <+>0>

we have that <+>0> = {1(+>0),2(+>0),3(+>0)...}

which has an equivalence relation to <1>

so can we assume <+>x> =: <x+1>, where =: means equiv. rel. ?

since <+>1> =: <2> and <+>2> =: <3> ?

no, a trivial counter-example is 

2(+>100) = [0, 1, 2, 99, 100, 101, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202]

lets examine <+>3>.

<+>3> - {+>3} =: <4> - {4}

so if we had a pattern starting at +>0,
then the number of elements subtracted for
a homomorphism to whole numbers then it'd
be 000 11 22 333 4 55 66 77 8

where 8 is the number of subtracted items from <+>17>

then we have that for example

<+10> - {+>10, ... , 4(+>10)} = <11> - {11, ... , 4(11)}

where we must subtract the first 4 elements of <+>10>

the pattern expanded up to 30

0-10: 000 11 22 333 4
11-20: 55 66 77 88 99 
21-30: 10 10 11 11 12 12 13 13 14 14

possible corollary:

adding (+>12) + 5(+>13) is valid

because 6(+>12) is valid and 5(+>13) isn't valid,

so if we add together these "pross" numbers (+>x)
and the resultant is an informal number (all sets with negative integer parity)

then, the minimum amount of additions needed to make pross addition valid
would be lowered by the pross number added with the smallest scalar needed
to be valid.
  
if +>x is odd then subtract 1 then halve the integer and thats the scalar
for the first full informal number made with +>x

if +>x is even subtract by two then halve the number.

corollary (subtraction):

subtraction must be analogous to integer subtraction
since,

1. scalars wouldn't work (then +>x - +>x != 0)
2. subtracting invalid sets together would be overly trivial

we have that +>1 = +>2 - +>0

hyp: maybe then +>3 = +>4 - +>0 ?

so,

+>10 + +>15 + +>5 is complete

+>10 + +>15 is incomplete

+>10 + +>15 + +>5 - +>z = +>y

+>10 + +>15 - +>z = +>x

(+>10 + +>15 + +>5) + +>2 = +[]35

since, (+>10 + +>15 + +>5) + +>2 = +[]32 + +>2

so, +[]35 - +>5 = x and

x = (+>10 + +>15 + +>2)

x - +>2 = (+>10 + +>15)

so x = +[]29 since,

+>2 + +>10 + +>15 = +[]29

then, x - +>2 - +>2 = +[]23 ?

such that, +>10 + +>15 - +>2 = +[] 23 ?

The subtraction algorithmn may require a very weird rule!

in order to subtract 

(+>10 + +>15) - +>2 we have to say that we are only
doing this in one direction

that means that the subtraction algorithm means you
have to only subtract every element of one set
with all the elements of the other set.

so if we do this subtraction then requiring a restriction
to the domain then,

(+>10 + +>15) could have had a domain of +[]26

but then, (+>10 + +>15) - +>2 is restricted to the domain of +[]23
so that means that subtraction moves the maximum a number can be
held within the set down to 0!

let o be a new subtraction type operator.

if we have +>10 + +>15 - +>2 = +[]23

then,

+[]23 o +>2 = +>10 + +>15

would o represent the analog of - (subtraction)

corollary: assume for sake of contradiction that if a linear combination 
were valid any number of them being negative is a valid
set down to 0 

how could a full set become an incomplete set after undoing a subtraction.
o operator would then mean regency operator because it works as an incomplete
addition in relation to incomplete subtraction!

o stands for regency, another subtractive operator

the solution to regency is finding incomplete linear combinations of any
kind that could be completed by adding the operated number to the ilc.

(+>10 + +>15) - +>2 o +>2 = (+>10 + +>15)

undoing subtraction could mean saving integer space by letting
the maximum of incomplete sets to be used as reserve calculations
previously done. why would taking a single degree of of doing
calculations matter if this operator would then only work on complete 
sets denoted +[]x then.

what would then, the sequence, x o +>n mean if n -> inf
assuming x is complete ?

what would o +>x be by itself?

so theoretically o +[]26 = (+>10 + +>15).

then also, o +>26 = (+>10 + +>15) ?

of course, at least, o +>26 = +>26 ?

so if o +[]inf = +>inf, then why

not inf -1, inf, inf + 1 ?

defense: inf + 1 being silly means maybe inf - 1 having to be real if 
inf + 1 is real could be a sound riddle in math.

so if we take inf + x  to infinity and inf - x to infinity then,

lim x->inf (inf - x) = 0 and NOT = -inf because then a lim is the only
way to add infinities together

so the lim x->inf (inf + x) = inf^2 with this argument.

only in an analogy then .. 

lim x->inf (inf - x) = inf * 0 = 0

lim x->inf (inf + x) = inf * inf = inf^2

could limits mean the convolution of variables ?

what about lim x->inf (inf * x) =  inf o inf
and, lim x->inf (inf / x) =  inf o- inf

but before that the question needs to be answered where
how would then,

lim x->inf (inf^2 - x) = inf

left handed subtraction group defense:

where long handed subtraction can mean pile math then that
missing algebra block is where addition is the or operand

by the argument 1 - 1 = 1 + (-1) where then saying that 
pushing any argument in an algebra to 0 could create
the pile math algebra block then

1 + (-1) ... 0 + (-1) ... 1 + 0 ... 0 + 0 

means 1 + -1 with a certain reformulation could mean +>0 when
+>0 means +/- 1 then, i hypothesize lha could be a reason
for why 0 is included in the set formula ..

+>x = {+/- x, +/- (x-1), +/- (x+1), 0}

if regency can undo a subtraction which means that regency is incomplete addition then
how could its inverse mean incomplete subtraction. the obvious assumptions is valid.
o- could take only complete sets to incomplete sets witha restricted domain like before.

multiplying incomplete sets could mean theoretically that,

+[]5 * +[]4 

is equal to both,

1. +[]4  o +[]4  o +[]4  o +[]4  o +[]4 
2. +[]5  o +[]5  o +[]5  o +[]5

corollary: assume for sake of contradiction that if a linear combination 
were valid any number of them being negative is a valid
set down to 0 

subtraction can complete ilc
proof.

if +[]20 - +[]20 = 0

then, - +[]20 should be complete then?

then, an ilc subtracted should complete
an ilc since,

subtracting further from a negative ilc
also would complete it?

o x - x = 0
o- x + x = 0

o- is more the analog to o
more than it is the functional inverse
because then that would be - for o & + for o-

o x o- x = 0
o- x o x = 0

assume o and o- cancel each other out

example for corollary:
+>10 + +>15 + +>2 = (+>13 + +>15 + +>2) - +>2

if o sends complete ilc to incomplete ilc then
o sends incomplete ilc to complete ilc. 

algebraically then the following wouldn't hold,

-x o x = 0
x o- x = 0 

+>10 + +>15 + +>2 = (+>13 + +>15 + +>2) - +>2

was generated by taking x = +>10 + +>15 + +>2

and noting the formula x o +>2 o- +>2 = x

another note is that in some cases that means
when o and o- are used on incomplete ilc
they end up being just normal + and -
