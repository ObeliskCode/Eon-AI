## R-Algebra

R-Algebra is math that uses the Reductive Proof Method.

R-Algebra derives formulas in Algebra with functional analysis.

= | stands for Reduction.
| = | stands for Irreducible Reduction

in a reductive proof anything is 0 at any point but,
that just means more pile math to simplify
later down the line - Noel

## R-Algebra

x uses only whole numbers 0,1,2,...,n to inf when, +>x is an informal number

+> x is equal to {-x-1,-x,-x+1,0,x-1,x,x+1}

+> x + >y = {all num in >x added together with all num in +>y}

a set only contains unique numbers!

+> x + >y = {[{all num in +>x}] + [{all num in +>y}]}

+>x + +>y = +>x - +>y = +>y - +>x
+> commutative subtraction

+>1 = e\*i

## Complex Number Analysis

scratch work:

[ i 1 | 1 i ] x [ i 1 | 1 i ] = [ 0 2i | 2i 0 ]

then ...

[ i e | e i ] x [ i e | i e ] = [ 0 {hard dirac} | 0 {hard dirac} ]

so ...

-1 + ei =| 0

e^2 + ei =| {hard dirac} =| 2ei

e^2 - 1 =| x =| 0

so,

e^i = +/- 1

how,

{hard dirac} =| 0 + 2ei

e^2 =| ei

-1 + ei =| -1 + e^2 =| 0 <=> e^2 =| ei =| 1

0 + 2ei =| e^2 + ei =| 2e^2

=>

e^2 =| +/> 1

## R-Algebra Group Proof

show, e^2 =| +> 1 since e^2 =| ei

<=> e^2 =| 1-1

i. e^2 - 1 =| 0 <=> 1*1 =| 0*1 =| 0 <=> 1/0 =| 0

-1 + e^2 =| 0

-1 + 0 =| 0

x =| 0

ii. -1 + ei =| 0 <=> x =| x

iii. e^2 + ei =| 0

1. x =| x

2. x =| 0

3. 1/0 =| 0

## Informal R-Algebra Theory

[ Write Here ]

axiom 1. {hard dirac} =| 0 + 2ei =| e^2 + ei =| +/> 1 + ei =| +/> 2

## R-Calculus

e^2 =| ei =| +> 1 =| 1-1 =| 0

-< 1 |=| ei (1.)

+> 1 |=| -< 1 (2.)

+> 1 |=| -< 1

+> 2 =| 1 + 1/1 =| 1+1 =| {hard dirac} =| 1-1 =| 1 - 1/1 =|-< 2

+>2 =| 2

+> 1 =| 1

-< 1 =| -1

e^2 =| +> 1

e^2 =| 0

e^2 =| 1-1

e^2 =| -< 1

=>

-< 1 |=| ei (1.)

xei =| +> x =| -< x

## Informal Algebra

e^i = +/- 1 \*(1)

e^i\*pi + 1 = 0 # eulers identity

(+/- 1)^pi + 1 =| 0

(+/- 1) + 1 =| 0

e^i + 1 =| 0

e^i =| -1

iln(e) = ln(-1)

iln(e) = i*pi # ln(-1) = i*pi

i = i\*pi # ln(e) = 1

=>

sqrt(1) = +/- 1 = e^i =| -1

=>

sqrt(1) + 1 =| 0

sqrt(n\*n) + n =| 0

+/- n + n =| 0

=>

sqrt(-1) = i = i\*pi = iln(e) = ln(-1) = ln(e^i)

e^sqrt(-1) = e^i = e^ln(e^i)

=>

sqrt(-n) = sqrt(n)*i = sqrt(n)*ln(e^i)

=>

e^sqrt(-1) = e^i = +/- 1 = sqrt(1)

sqrt(n) = e^sqrt(-n)

sqrt(n) = e^i\*sqrt(n)

=>

sqrt(1/4) = 1/2

sqrt(-1/4) = e^sqrt(1/4) = e^i\*sqrt(-1/4) = +/- sqrt(-1/4) = +/- isqrt(1/4)
= +/- i1/2

=>

sqrt(n) = e^sqrt(-n) = e^i\*sqrt(n) = +/- sqrt(n)

sqrt(-n) = +/- isqrt(n)

## i hypothesis (i is an irrational number)

e^i = cos(1) + isin(1) = +/- 1 = 0.54030230586 + isin(1)

=>

isin(1) = 0.45969769414 or -1.54030230586

sin(1) = 0.8414709848

i = 0.45969769414 / 0.8414709848 or -1.54030230586 / 0.8414709848

i = 0.54630248985 or -1.83048772172

## Ordinality of informal Addition Relations

+/- ln(e) = 2ei = 1 or 2 or 3 = +/> 2

e^i + ei = 1(ln(e)) or 2 or 3 = +/> 2

+/> 0 = 0 or 1 or -1 = (+/> 1)\*(0)

+/> 0 = +/> 1 \* 0 = 0 or +/> 0 , since (1)

(*1) x = 0 = x*0 = 0\*0 = 0 !

thus,

+>x = +/- x or +/- (x-1) or +/- (x+1) or 0

so, +>x can return a set of either 3,5 or 7 numbers

## informal Group Theory

+>x + +>y = +>x - +>y = +y - +>x (1.)

1. both informal addition and informal subtraction are commutative

+>x + +>y = {all numbers in both +>x added together} = N

2. the set N can return either 5,7,...,19,21,...,31,33 numbers

3. there are 15 different cardinalities for the set of adding two informal numbers
   together

## informal Number Theory

I wish to officially call +>x informal numbers

here is a couple simple proofs for the informal Number Set.

Solve. +>1 \* +>2

to solve find all unique numbers in [-2,-1,0,1,2] \* [-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3]

=> {-6,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,6}
note: only the upper triangle of the matrix needs to be calculated

Assume for sake of contradiction division were not possible in the informal number
set

to be considered an informal number it'd require for the addition after a division
to be,

contained within the set O of informal numbers

solve.

the simplest assumption is that +>x \* +>y = +>x / +>y = +>y / +>X

which is that division is commutative and exactly the same as multiplication

## New Calculus

by S i mean integral.

S(2e^2)dx = 2e^2x + c = c + 2xei = c + 2(+>x)

so, e^2x = +>x and +>x = xei thus, +>x is an imaginary component

this means that 2(+>x) + c requires reductive proofs to be able to be related to algebra "R-Algebra"

+>x + +>x = xe^2 + xe^2 = 2xe^2 = 2+>x

so, +>1 + +>1 = 2+>1 NOTEQ +>2

thus, in order to compute 2+>x it'd require H(+>x + +>x) where H relates informal numbers to the irrationals R/Q

the calculation of the set +>x + +>x is trivial and linear but what computational requirements does H take?

+>2 + +>2 = {-6,...,6} = +>1 + +>3

+>4 + +>4 = {-10,...,10} = +>3 + +>5 = +>2 + +>6 NOTEQ +>1 + +>7

+>40 + +>40 = [-82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -41, -40, -39, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 39, 40, 41, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82]

+>39 + +>41 = [-82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -42, -41, -40, -39, -38, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82]

+>38 + +>42 = [-82, -81, -80, -79, -78, -43, -42, -41, -39, -38, -37, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82]

so +>40 + +>40 NOTEQ +>39 + +>41 NOTEQ +>38 + +>42

+>4 + +>4 = +>1 + +>2 + +>4 = +>4 + +>2 + +>1 = +>2 + +>1 + +>2 + +>1

+>8 + +>8 = [-18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -9, -8, -7, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]

4(+>4) = 4(+>2) + 4(+>1)

so , x(+>4) = x(+>2) + x(+>1)

we have, 2x(+>4) = x(+>2) + x(+>6)

+>5 + +>5 = [-12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -6, -5, -4, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

... + +>5 = [-18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]

+>2 + +>2 = [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

... + +>2 = [-9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

... + +>1 = [-11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

... + +>1 = [-13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

... + +>1 = [-15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

... + +>2 = [-18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]

so, 3(+>5) = 4(+>2) + 3(+>1) = 3(+>4) + +>2

thus, 15e^2 = H(3(+>4) + +>2)e^2

3x(+>5) = 3x(+>4) + x(+>2) CORRECT (1.)

3x(5e^2) = 3x(4e^2) + 2x(e^2) ERROR (1.)

(1.) this allows you to do the work to
calculate 15xe^2 with 1 less integer required than in
regular O(1) calculations possibly O(-1) due to number packing

H([->102,+>102]) = H(9(+>9) + +>7 + +>3) = 102

H([[2,3],[3,2]](+\*)) = 26508

a 2x2 informal matrix can hold 26508 numbers with only integers <= 3

lets examine[[2,3],[3,2]](+\*)

## Informal Subtraction and Simplification(div operation)

if an nxn(+\*) matrix be allocated a numeric in another matrix,
then an nxn(nxn(+\*)) matrrix would still aloow for ordinary matrix operations
on top of the existing thinner matrix which fits perfectly as subset speed for
found numerics which minimize the computational bound of H to O(1)

ergo, this could lead to faster matrix multiplication algorithms
for most non-trivial computations

so informal number theory suggest matrices contain matrices within matrices

informal subtraction (trivial):

+>4 - +>2 = {-5,5} - {-3,3} = {-5,-5,0,4,5}

obviously using integer subtraction within informal calc. is commutative
same thing for division and subtraction, but informal subtraction
is not integer subtraction! (set closure)

thus,

+>0 - +>0 = {0}

Simplication(Informal Division) Proofs

Q: we said that +>4 meant a solution which means choice for elements in the set

we can quantify it into one number then do some operation probably just
multiplication again to the whole set as one operation to the whole set...

this means division is about multiplication by selection sorting H or maybe h
another conjector function similar to H in the same field of conjector funcs?

so, is it the func H or h which relates Simplification?

u suggest that h is the new function which relates higher dim informal matrices
to lower informal matrix spaces but not to integers!

so if simplification (/) were a real operation in informal numbers regardless
it'd have to send itself as a function from ->n +>x= -> ->1 +>x (n dim to 1 dim)

the example matrix multiplication is the first order of informal (simplification)

INFORMAL MATRIX SIMPLIFICATION ALGORITHM IN 1D:
------------[b1,b2,b3,b4,b5]
[a1, a2, a3, a4]------------

1D informal matrix simpl requires stacking matrices like this.

also, note:

1. x/0 =| 0 =| 0/x =| 0

2. there are three simpl functions, (/-), (/+), (/\*)

calculating (/+) is the easiest one to calc

there are 6 2d axes to manage in this system in total

(-,/), (+,/), (_,/), (_,+), (-,+), (-,\*)

## 4-D -> 6-D extension

+, -, \*, / are all formally defined operations in the informal number system

[+ := set add.,- := set subt.,* := set mult.,/ := simpl.]

so, (-,/), (+,/), (_,/), (_,+), (-,+), (-,_)
= (+,-,_),(+,-,/),(+,_,/),(-,_,/) => 4-D

so for 6-D we have

[1]:[(+,-,*),(+,-,/)]
[2]:[(+,-,*),(+,*,/)]
[3]:[(+,-,*),(-,*,/)]
[4]:[(+,-,/),(+,*,/)]
[5]:[(+,-,/),(-,*,/)]
[6]:[(+,*,/),(-,*,/)]

where for example we have the operator h then,

(+,-,\*) h (+,-,/) |=| (x,y,z) ?

## Golden ratio theory

golden ratio p

p = (1+sqrt(5))/2

let p' = (1+sqrt(-5))/2 then,

p |=| x =| p' |=| 1+sqrt(-5) |=| 2x |=| sqrt(-5) |=| 2x - 1

sqrt(-5) |=| +/- i(sqrt(5))

+/- i |=| (2x-1)/sqrt(5)

+/- i |=| p/p |=| 1
